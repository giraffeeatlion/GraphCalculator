Zoom Logic refined but still looks little odd but using the timer is a much better.
Solver uses the same function for saddle point finding.
Solver is fine but the refinement can be done with Plotter.
Still have to find a way to plot area.
Saddle points and zeroes are in the same exact place (have to add an extra series). Refinement can be done with adding a seperate method for dealing with series ka things.
Saddle points and zeroes are not calculated if xbounds are more than 50.
